.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
\" Options that take parameters can have the values passed in two ways,
\" --option=value or --option value. However boolean (true/false)
\" options behave slightly differently to the other options in that
\" --boolean sets the option to true and the absence of the flag sets
\" it to false. It is also possible to specify --boolean=false or
\" --boolean=true. Note that --boolean false is not valid - this is
\" parsed as --boolean and the false is parsed as an extra command
\" line argument for rclone.

\" Options which use TIME use the go time parser. A duration string is a
\" possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional
\" fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "-1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid
\" time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".

\" Options which use SIZE use kByte by default. However, a suffix of b
\" for bytes, k for kBytes, M for MBytes, G for GBytes, T for
\" TBytes and P for PBytes may be used. These are the binary units, e.g.
\" 1, 2\*\*10, 2\*\*20, 2\*\*30 respectively.

.Bl -tag -width Ds
\" .It Fl Fl backup-dir Ar dir
\" This will contain any files which would have been overwritten or deleted by
\" .Cm sync ,
\" .Cm copy
\" or
\" .Cm move.
\" Original hierarchy is preserved.
\" If
\" .Fl Fl suffix
\" is set, the moved files will have the suffix added
\" to them. If there is a file with the same path (after the suffix has
\" been added) in DIR, then it will be overwritten.
\" .Pp
\" The remote in use must support server-side move or copy and you must
\" use the same remote as the destination of the sync. The backup
\" directory must not overlap the destination directory.
\" .It Fl Fl bind Ar string
\" Local address to bind to for outgoing connections. This can be an
\" IPv4 address (1.2.3.4), an IPv6 address (1234::789A) or host name. If
\" the host name doesn't resolve or resolves to more than one IP address
\" it will give an error.
\" .It Fl Fl bwlimit Ar bandwidth_spec
\" Controls the bandwidth limit. For the duration of the session,
\" specify the desired bandwidth in kBytes/s (not kBit/s !!), or use a suffix
\" .Ar b|k|M|G (in Bytes).
\" The
\" default is 0 which means to not limit bandwidth.
\" For example, to limit bandwidth usage to 10 MBytes/s use
\" .Fl Fl bwlimit Ar 10M
\" .Pp
\" To set limits at certain times,specify a "timetable" by format your
\" entries as
\" .Ar bandwidth
\" .Op Ar weekday- Ns
\" .Ar HH:MM Ns , Op Ar weekday- Ns
\" .Ar HH:MM ...
\" where : HH:MM is an hour from 00:00 to 23:59.
\" An example of a typical timetable to avoid link saturation during daytime
\" working hours could be:
\" .Dl Fl Fl bwlimit "08:00,512 12:00,10M 13:00,512 18:00,30M 23:00,off"
\" It mean that, the transfer bandwidth will be set to 512kBytes/sec on Monday.
\" It will raise to 10Mbytes/s before the end of Friday.
\" At 10:00 on Sunday it will be set to 1Mbyte/s.
\" From 20:00 at Sunday will be unlimited.
\" .Pp
\" Timeslots without weekday are extended to whole week.
\" So this:
\" .Dl Fl Fl bwlimit "Mon-00:00,512 12:00,1M Sun-20:00,off"
\" Is equal to this:
\" .Dl Fl Fl bwlimit "Mon-00:00,512Mon-12:00,1M Tue-12:00,1M Wed-12:00,1M Thu-12:00,1M Fri-12:00,1M Sat-12:00,1M Sun-12:00,1M Sun-20:00,off"
\" .Pp
\" Bandwidth limits only apply to the data transfer. They don't apply to the
\" bandwidth of the directory listings etc.
\" .Pp
\" On Unix systems (Linux, macOS, …) the bandwidth limiter can be toggled by
\" sending a SIGUSR2 signal to rclone. This allows to remove the limitations
\" of a long running rclone transfer and to restore it back to the value specified
\" with --bwlimit quickly when needed. Assuming there is only one rclone instance
\" running, you can toggle the limiter like this:
\" .Dl kill -SIGUSR2 $(pidof rclone)
\" .Pp
\" If you configure rclone with a [remote control](/rc) then you can use
\" change the bwlimit dynamically:
\" .Dl rclone rc core/bwlimit rate=1M
\" .It Fl Fl -bwlimit-file=bandwidth_spec
\" controls per file bandwidth limit. See
\" .Fl Fl bwlimit .
\" Both options can be used. Note that if a schedule is provided the file will use the schedule in
\" effect at the start of the transfer.
\" .It Fl Fl -buffer-size Arg size
\" Use this sized buffer to speed up file transfers. Each
\" .Fl Fl transfer
\" will use this much memory for buffering.

\" When using
\" .Cm mount
\" or
\" .Cm cmount e,
\" ach open file descriptor will use this much memory for buffering. See
\" .Cm mount
\" for more details.
\" .Pp
\" Set to 0 to disable the buffering for the minimum memory usage.
\" .Pp
\" Note that the memory allocation of the buffers is influenced by
\" .Fl Fl use-mmap.
\" .It Fl Fl check-first
\" If this flag is set then in a
\" .Cm sync
\" .Cm copy
\" or
\" .Cm move ,
\" .Nm rclone
\" will do all the checks to see whether files need to be transferred before
\" doing any of the transfers. Normally rclone would start running transfers as
\" soon as possible.
\" .Pp
\" This flag can be useful on IO limited systems where transfers
\" interfere with checking.
\" .Pp
\" Using this flag can use more memory as it effectively sets
\" .Fl Fl max-backlog
\" to infinite. This means that all the info on the
\" objects to transfer is held in memory before the transfers start.
\" .It Fl Fl checkers Ar N
\" Number of checkers to run in parallel, default is 8. Checkers do the equality
\" checking of files during a sync. For some storage systems (e.g. S3,
\" Swift, Dropbox) this can take a significant amount of time so they are
\" run in parallel.
\" .It Fl c, Fl Fl checksum
\" By default, modification time and size of files are used to compare file. If this flag is sset, file hash and size are used instead.
\" .Pp
\" This is useful when the remote doesn't support setting modified time
\" and a more accurate sync is desired than just checking the file size.
\" This is very useful when transferring between remotes which store the
\" same hash type on the object, e.g. Drive and Swift. For details of which
\" remotes support which hash type see the table in the [overview
\" section](/overview/). For example
\" .Dl rclone --checksum sync s3:/bucket swift:/bucket
\" would run much quicker than without
\" .Fl Fl checksum
\" .Pp
\" When using this flag, rclone won't update mtimes of remote files if
\" they are incorrect as it would normally.
\" .It Fl Fl compare-dest Ar dir
\" When using
\" .Cm sync ,
\" .Cm copy
\" or
\" .Cm move
\" .Ar dir
\" is checked in addition to the
\" destination for files. If a file identical to the source is found that
\" file is NOT copied from source. This is useful to copy just files that
\" have changed since the last backup.
\" .Pp
\" You must use the same remote as the destination of the sync. The
\" compare directory must not overlap the destination directory.
\" See
\" .Fl Fl copy-dest
\" and
\" .Fl Fl backup-dir .
\" .It Fl Fl -config Ar file
\" Override the location of the rclone config file. Default is
\" .Pa $HOME/.config/rclone/rclone.conf
\" (or
\" .Pa .rclone.conf
\" if created with an
\" older version). If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set it will be at
\" .Pa $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rclone/rclone.conf.
\" .Pp
\" If there is a file
\" .Pa rclone.conf
\" in the same directory as the rclone
\" executable it will be preferred. This file must be created manually
\" for Rclone to use it, it will never be created automatically.
\" .Pp
\" Running
\" .Cm rclone config file
\" will show the default location.
\" .It Fl Fl -contimeout Ar time
\" Set the connection timeout, that is the amount of time rclone will wait for a
\" connection to go through to a remote object storage system. It is 1m by
\" default. This should be in go time format which looks like 5s for 5 seconds,
\" 10m for 10 minutes, or 3h30m.
\" .It Fl --copy-dest Ar dir
\" When using
\" .Cm sync ,
\" .Cm copy
\" or
\" .Cm move,
\" .Ar dir
\" is checked in addition to the
\" destination for files. If a file identical to the source is found that
\" file is server-side copied from
\" .Ar dir
\" to the destination. This is useful for incremental backup.
\" .Pp
\" The remote in use must support server-side copy and you must
\" use the same remote as the destination of the sync. The compare
\" directory must not overlap the destination directory.
\" .Pp
\" See
\" .Fl Fl compare-dest
\" and
\" .Fl Fl --backup-dir.
\" .It Fl --dedupe-mode Ar mode
\" Mode to run dedupe command in. Values are :
\" .Ar interactive , Ar skip, Ar first, Ar newest, Ar oldest, Ar rename .
\" The default is interactive. See the
\" .Cm dedupe
\" command for more information as to what these options mean.
\" .It Fl --disable Ar FEATURE , Ns Ar FEATURE, Ns ...
\" This disables a comma separated list of optional features.
\" To see a list of which features can be disabled use
\" .Fl Fl disable Ar help.
\" This flag can be useful for debugging and in exceptional circumstances
\" (e.g. Google Drive limiting the total volume of Server Side Copies to
\" 100GB/day).
\" .Pp
\" For example, to disable server-side move and server-side copy use:
\" .Fl Fl disable Ar move, Ns Ar copy .
\" The features can be put in any case.
\" .It Fl n , Fl Fl dry-run
\" Do a trial run with no permanent changes. Use this to see what rclone
\" would do without actually doing it. Useful when setting up the
\" .Cm sync
\" command which deletes files in the destination.
\" .It Fl Fl expect-continue-timeout Ar time
\" Specifies the amount of time to wait for a server's first
\" response headers after fully writing the request headers if the
\" request has an "Expect: 100-continue" header. Not all backends support
\" using this.
\" .Pp
\" Zero means no timeout and causes the body to be sent immediately,
\" without waiting for the server to approve. This time does not include
\" the time to send the request header.
\" .Pp
\" The default is 1s. Set to 0 to disable.
\" .It Fl Fl error-on-no-transfer
\" If there are no errors, rclone will exit with return code 0.
\" This option allows rclone to return exit code 9 if no files were transferred
\" between the source and destination. This allows using rclone in scripts, and
\" triggering follow-on actions if data was copied, or skipping if not.
\" .Pp
\" Enabling this option turns a usually non-fatal error into a potentially
\" fatal one - please check and adjust your scripts accordingly!
\" .It Fl Fl header
\" Add a single HTTP header for all transactions. Can be repeated to add multiple headers. For upload/download only, see
\" .Fl Fl header-upload
\" and
\" .Fl Fl header-download .
\" This flag is supported for all HTTP based backends even those not
\" supported by
\" .Fl Fl header-upload
\" and
\" .Fl Fl header-download .
\" .It Fl Fl header-download
\" Like
\" .Fl Fl header
\" but for download only.
\" .It Fl Fl header-upload
\" Like
\" .Fl Fl header
\" but for upload only.
\" .It Fl Fl ignore-case-sync
\" Files will not be copied/synced when the existing filenames are the same, even if the casing is different.
\" .It Fl ignore-checksum
\" Disables the default checksum verification. Only use it
\" if you have had the
\" .Qq Corrupted on transfer
\" error message and you are sure you
\" might want to transfer potentially corrupted data.
\" .It Fl Fl ignore-existing
\" Skip all files that exist on the destination, no matter the content of these
\" files. It can be useful in cases where your files change due to encryption.
\" However, it cannot correct partial transfers in case a transfer was interrupted.
\" .It Fl Fl ignore-size TODO
\" Only check the modification time, instead of both the modification time and size of files.
\" If
\" .Fl Fl checksum
\" is set then it only
\" checks the checksum.
\" .Pp
\" This can be useful for transferring files to and from OneDrive which
\" occasionally misreports the size of image files.
\" .It Fl I, Fl Fl ignore-times
\" Unconditionally upload all files regardless of the state of files on the destination.
\" Normally any files with the same modification time and are the same size are skipped.
\" .It Fl Fl immutable
\" Treat source and destination files as immutable and disallow
\" modification.
\" .Pp
\" With this option set, files will be created and deleted as requested,
\" but existing files will never be updated. If an existing file does
\" not match between the source and destination, rclone will give the error
\" .Qq Source and destination exist but do not match: immutable file modified .
\" .Pp
\" Note that only commands which transfer files (e.g.
\" .Cm sync ,
\" .Cm copy ,
\" .Cm move )
\" are affected by this behavior, and only modification is
\" disallowed. Files may still be deleted explicitly (e.g.
\" .Cm delete,
\" .Cm purge )
\" or implicitly (e.g.
\" .Cm sync,
\" .Cm move ) .
\" Use
\" .Cm copy Fl Fl immutable
\" if it is desired to avoid deletion as well as modification.
\" .Pp
\" This can be useful as an additional layer of protection for immutable
\" or append-only data sets (notably backup archives), where modification
\" implies corruption and should not be propagated.
\" .It Fl i, Fl Fl interactive
\" Ask for manual confirmation before destructive operations.
\" It is
\" .Em recommended
\" that you use this flag while learning rclone, especially with
\" .Cm sync .
\" .It Fl Fl leave-root
\" During
\" .Cm rmdirs ,
\" it will not remove root directory, even if it's empty.
\" .It Fl Fl log-file Ar file
\" Log all of rclone's output to
\" .Ar file .
\" This is not active by default.
\" This can be useful for tracking down problems with syncs in
\" combination with the
\" .Fl v flag.
\" If
\" .Ar file
\" exists then rclone will append to it.
\" .Pp
\" Note that if you are using the
\" .Cm logrotate
\" program to manage rclone's logs, then you should use the
\" .Cm copytruncate
\" option as rclone doesn't have a signal to rotate logs.
.It Fl Fl log-format Ar list
Comma separated list of log format options. Possible values are :
.Qq date ,
.Qq time ,
.Qq microseconds ,
.Qq longfile ,
.Qq shortfile ,
.Qq UTC
The default is
.Qq date, time .
